# 2D-grid-by-using-4-overhead-cameras
The project aims to create a system that captures images from multiple cameras in a 3D room, stitches these images into a seamless panoramic view, and converts the stitched image into a 2D grid map. This grid map will represent object positions and dimensions, enabling efficient robot navigation and obstacle avoidance.

## Problem Statement

Develop a 2D Occupancy Grid Map of a Room using four Overhead Cameras

## Solution

## Multi-Camera Setup:

Install and calibrate four cameras in the room to capture different perspectives without overlapping views.
## Image Capture:

Capture images simultaneously from all four cameras.
## Image Stitching:

- **Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and convert images to grayscale.
- **Feature Detection:** Use SIFT/ORB algorithms to detect key features in the images.
- **Feature Matching:** Match features across images using FLANN.
-**Homography Estimation:** Use RANSAC to estimate homography and align images.
-**Image Blending:** Blend the aligned images into a seamless panoramic view.
## 2D Grid Mapping:

Convert the stitched image into a 2D grid map.
Represent objects in the room as lines or dots on the grid based on their dimensions.
## Navigation and Obstacle Detection:

- **Distance Calculation:** Calculate distances between various points on the grid.
- **Path Planning:** Use algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or A* to plan optimal paths and avoid obstacles.
## Performance Evaluation:

Measure the accuracy of the grid map and computational latency to ensure real-time performance.

## Tech Stack

## Hardware:

- **Cameras:** High-resolution cameras capable of capturing clear images from different angles.
- **Computing Device:** A powerful computer or server with sufficient processing power and memory.

## Software:

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution for robust performance and compatibility with simulation and vision libraries.
- **Gazebo:** For simulating the environment and camera setup.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System):** For integrating different components and managing communication between them.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing tasks such as resizing, normalization, feature detection, and stitching.
- **Python/C++:** For writing scripts and algorithms for image processing, stitching, and grid mapping.
- **Pandas/Numpy:** For data manipulation and handling large datasets efficiently.
- **SciPy:** For scientific computations, including optimization algorithms used in stitching and mapping.
